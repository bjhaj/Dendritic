# Dendritic

Dendrites are fascinating branching structures that exhibit
randomness; yet they are unique, non-repeatable, and identifiable
with the right algorithmic innovations. Unlike barcodes,
which are essentially linear structures, dendrites are naturally
random. For this reason, it is very difficult for dendrites to be
replicated, ensuring that each dendrite is secure and unique.
While there have not yet been any established methods on
reading dendritic patterns for verification using image data,
identifying dendrites using a computer vision approach could
have high potential. 

However, due to limited data and low variance, dendrite identification 
can be considered a fine-grained classification task.
